### About this project :

- WISE2MBH is a simple an effective algorithm that uses infrared cataloged data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) to estimate the mass of supermassive black holes (SMBH)

- It implements a Monte Carlo approach for error propagation, considering mean photometric errors from WISE magnitudes, errors in fits of scaling relations used and scatter of those relations, if available.

- Actual stage of publication: **Submitted to MNRAS**

- Actual stage of final sample: **Awaiting acceptance in MNRAS**

- Actual stage of scripts and package: **Developing general use version**
